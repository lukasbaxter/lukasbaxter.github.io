	<p>this is ava's bat page.Bats sleep upside down because they cant get take off any other way. Bats are not able to launch into flight from an upright position because their wings do not generate sufficient lift while at a dead stop. As they fly they, make shouting sounds. The returning echoes give the bats information about anything that is ahead of them, including the size and shape of an insect and which way it is going. This system of finding prey is called echolocation - locating things by their echoes.The almost 1000 species of bats that eat all types of food. The group of microbats mostly eat small flying night bugs like mosquitoes, moths and others. The megabats mostly eat ripe fruit found in the rainforests. There are other bats that eat strange food such as frogs, fish, scorpions, and plant nectar.Echolocation is the use of sound waves and echoes to determine where objects are in space. Bats use echolocation to navigate and find food in the dark. To echolocate, bats send out sound waves from their mouth or nose. When the sound waves hit an object they produce echoes.In winter, bats use hibernation roosts. Bats have been discovered roosting in all sorts of places, but there are three broad roost types that are the most common: roosts in trees, roosts in built structures and roosts in underground sites. Bats may also roost in bat boxes.Bats can be either colonial bats, living in colonies, or solitary bats, living alone or with just a few other bats. ... Winter hibernation is an instinct felt by all domestic bat species. Some travel less than 100 miles, while others travel thousands of miles from their summer roost.Bats do not build nests; instead, when at rest most species cling to walls and ceilings of caves and to rafters of buildings using their hind feet. Their wings are folded next to the body. Bats that roost in small crevices commonly assume a horizontal posture.During the day bats sleep in trees, rock crevices, caves, and buildings. Bats are nocturnal (active at night), leaving daytime roosts at dusk. Upon leaving their roost, bat fly to a stream, pond, or lake where they dip their lower jaw into the water while still in flight and take a drink.To put this in perspective, a bat living longer than 30 years is equivalent to a human living longer than 100 years. Bats, for their size, are the world's longest-lived mammals. Yet unlike other mammals of their size, bats have very low reproductive rates, females of most species producing just one pup per year.
